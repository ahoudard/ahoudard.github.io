Je présente le [modèle HDMI](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01544249v2) au séminaire doctorant du LAMFA à Amiens mardi 24 octobre.

Abstract: In this talk, we first present a statistical framework for patch-based image denoising. This framework requires the inference of statistical models in high dimensional spaces which leads to several challenges due to the curse of dimensionality. To tackle this, we propose a model with intrinsic dimensionality reduction which yields state-of-the-art results in image denoising.
