## Super-sampling for fast rendering of video games

**Abstract**. The goal of this intership is to study and implement super-sampling methods for high resolution rendering of video games.

**Supervision**. The intern will be supervised by aresearch engineer from Ubisoft La Forge located in Bordeaux.

##### Subject

Nowadays, video games require both high image quality and high frame rate. Today's standards are ultra high-definition 4K (4096x2160) with a frame rate of 60 FPS. Going from HD resolution (1920x1080) at 30 FPS to 4K at 60 FPS requires at least 8 times more ressources. In another hand, the Moore's law is not true anymore and many users don't have latest hardware. In this context, solutions based on super-resolution have been proposed to display at lower cost ultra HD images generated from lower resolution images:

1. The FSR technology from AMR which is a super-sampling method using signal processing tools ;
2. The DLSS technology from Nvidia which is a super-sampling method using deep learning.

Both methods increase performances up to 200%. However, visual results can be hard to evaluate and can be very different depending on the game.

On the other hand, super-sampling is a hot topic from the scientific literature, although these approaches are not always suited for real-time or memory constraints that arise from the video game rendering.

This internship aim at exploring the literature in order to bring inovation for enhancing game rendering with super-sampling.
